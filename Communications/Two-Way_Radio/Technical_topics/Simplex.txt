====== Simplex ======
Created Tuesday 27 December 2022

Simplex is a fancy word for communications that go directly from one radio to another without any sort of intermediating [[Repeaters]] or networks. 

Simplex communications require that there either be a clear line of sight between radios, or one of several propagation phenomena enhancing the range of the radio.  

In most cases, simplex communications on VHF-high band and higher are very short-range.  VHF-low band and HF, however, have sufficient range for simplex to be very usable.
