====== Emergency Kit ======
Created Monday 26 December 2022

In a video on 2019-04-22, Beau of the Fifth Column gave a rundown of what should be in an emergency bag.  The talk is called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzKSVhY-S-I|Let's talk about a guy named Rooster and emergency preparedness....]]

In an emergency, there are people who will come to help, however, the more self-reliant you are, the less strees you will put on those resources.

One of Beau's points is that quite often people will tell you that they have all of this stuff, but the problem is that you need it all together and in a place where you can grab it and go.
