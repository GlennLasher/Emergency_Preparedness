Maintaining a financial supply will mean different things to different people.  Some suggestions, from the most basic to the most extreme:

* Cash
	* Decide how much to keep on hand
	* Divide that amount into several different storage places
		* Put at least a $20 bill into your phone case
	* Don't keep it all in large bills.  Have enough small bills on hand to make exact change
* Savings
	* If you can afford to do so, set aside some portion of your assets in a savings account.  
	* This is not an investment; you are parking money here for easy access.
	* Don't touch it unless you need it.
* Precious metals
	* Some folks also recommend storing value in precious metals.  Only do this if you are comfortable with it.
