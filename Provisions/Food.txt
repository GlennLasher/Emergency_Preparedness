Keeping a well-organized pantry, refrigerator and freezer is the key to managing your backup supply of food.  

A recommended approach is to make a minimum provisions list (MPL), which lists off all of the items that should be in your pantry, and how much.  Before you go grocery shopping, make a shopping list from the MPL.  Some suggested things to put on your list:

[ ] Fruits
	[ ] Raisins/other dried fruit
	[ ] Canned fruits
[ ] Nuts
[ ] Proteins
	[ ] Dried/frozen/canned meats or meat substitutes
	[ ] Dried/canned beans
	[ ] Powdered eggs/milk
[ ] Grains/pasta
	[ ] Cereals/Oatmeal/Grits, etc
	[ ] Pasta in various formats (maybe include high-protein varieties)
	[ ] Rice (Especially inexpensive in some ethnic grocery stores)
[ ] Flourishes
	[ ] Sauces, such as marinara or salsa to complete foods
	[ ] Spices
	[ ] Tea
[ ] Don't forget your pets
	[ ] Supply of dry/canned pet food
	[ ] Cat litter
